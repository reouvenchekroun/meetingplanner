The angular front is int src/main/front

The application misses some features :
 * Values control in the meeting creation form
 * Exception handling
 * No Persistence

To start the application :
* Run MeetingPlannerApplication to start the back-end
* In src/main/front, launch ng serve and start http://localhost:4200/
